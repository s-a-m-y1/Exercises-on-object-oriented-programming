## 📝 Introduction

A high-performance **Console-based Bank Management System** engineered with **C++**. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, featuring a modular architecture designed for security, scalability, and an intuitive user experience within a terminal environment.

## 🚀 Main Features

### 🔐 1. Authentication & Access Control
- **Robust Login System:** Multi-step credential verification to ensure system integrity.
- **Dynamic Permissions:** Role-based access control (Admin vs. User) that dynamically toggles available features.
- **Session Management:** Secure handling of active user states throughout the application lifecycle.

### 👥 2. Client & User Administration
- **Full CRUD Operations:** Seamlessly Create, Read, Update, and Delete client and user records.
- **Strict Data Validation:** Logic-driven checks to prevent duplicate Account Numbers or Usernames.
- **Advanced UI Tables:** Custom-formatted, color-coded tables for professional data visualization.

### 💰 3. Financial Transactions & Auditing
- **Core Banking:** Real-time Deposit, Withdrawal, and Balance inquiry operations.
- **Secure Fund Transfers:** Validated peer-to-peer transfers with immediate ledger updates.
- **Comprehensive Audit Logs:** Automated logging of all transfers and login activities for administrative oversight.

### 🌍 4. Currency Exchange Engine
- **Global Exchange Rates:** Centralized management of currency values relative to the base currency (USD).
- **Automated Calculator:** Precise conversion tool for calculating exchange amounts across multiple global currencies.

## 🔐 Cryptographic Engine (5-Layer Security)
To protect sensitive financial data, the system utilizes a custom-built **multi-stage encryption pipeline**:
1. **XOR Cipher:** Fundamental stream encryption using a private key.
2. **Noise Injection:** Strategic random padding to obscure data patterns.
3. **Bitwise Casing:** Inversion logic to alter character byte representation.
4. **Nested XOR:** A secondary encryption pass for increased complexity.
5. **Hexadecimal Encoding:** Final storage in hex format to render raw data files unreadable to standard text editors.
